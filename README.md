# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images.
The model has been trained and tested on a labeled dataset, achieving an 80% accuracy.
The dataset consists of MRI scans labeled as tumor or non-tumor images.
It extracts features from images through convolution and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for final classification, demonstrating how AI can assist in faster and more reliable medical diagnosis.
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, trained on processed images, and evaluated on a separate test set.
