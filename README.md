# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI scan images. Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is crucial for timely treatment and improving patient outcomes. Leveraging deep learning, this system aims to support medical professionals by automating the initial diagnostic process.

The model has been trained and tested on a labeled dataset consisting of MRI images categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes. It automatically learns important visual features using multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers to make the final classification. This eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and makes the solution more scalable.

The implementation is built using TensorFlow/Keras and involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The trained model achieved an 80% classification accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to assist in faster and more reliable medical diagnosis.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used for training is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains a collection of MRI scans labeled for supervised learning, enabling the CNN to distinguish between normal and tumor-affected brain images effectively.
